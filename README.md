# Data for Azeroth
The companion addon for Data for Azeroth!

This will show a tooltip when you meet one of the top collectors in the world. Their character's tooltip will show the player's completion score, percent completion, and leaderboard rankings.

Completion score ranks players based on a weighted score of completed content. 100 points for mounts, toys, titles, exalted reputations, and leveled pets (pet score). 10 points for recipes and quests. 3 points per achievement point. 1 point for appearance sources. (Weights are subject to change.)

## Problem? Suggestion?
If you just updated and are getting tons of errors, completely close your game and then reopen it. Updating addons while the game is running can cause problems!
