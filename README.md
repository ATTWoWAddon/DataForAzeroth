## Features
- See the DataForAzeroth rankings for yourself and other players in the game on their tooltips!

## Release Schedule
There are two release types, alpha build and official release.
- Alpha Build
    - Released at 7:00 UTC every day.
- Official Release
    - Scheduled every Sunday.

## Why do I need this addon?
- Because you do!

## Problem? Suggestion?
If you just updated and are getting tons of errors, completely close your game and then reopen it. Updating addons while the game is running can cause problems!
